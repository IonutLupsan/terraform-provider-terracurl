If you wish to work on the provider, you'll first need Go installed on your machine (see Requirements above).

To compile the provider, update the makefile with your OS architecture, then run make install. This will build the provider and put the provider binary in the ~/.terraform.d/plugins/local/ directory.

To generate or update documentation, run make docs.

In order to run the full suite of Acceptance tests, run make test.

Note: Acceptance tests create real resources, and often cost money to run.
