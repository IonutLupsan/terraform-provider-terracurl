# TERRACURL Provider

TOOD

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.

## Example Usage

As of Terraform 1.8 and later, providers can implement functions that you can call from the Terraform configuration.

Define the provider as a `required_provider` to use its functions

```terraform
provider "terracurl" {
  # No configuration required here
}
```

## Limitations
